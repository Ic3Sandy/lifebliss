# Todo Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Todo feature implements a task management system that demonstrates communication between JavaScript, Flutter, and native platforms. This feature showcases:

1. Flutter UI for displaying and managing todo items
2. JavaScript to Flutter communication via WebView
3. Flutter to native code communication via MethodChannel
4. Native dialog display for todo details

## Components

### Models
- `Todo`: Represents a todo item with id, title, and completion status

### Services
- `TodoService`: Handles native code communication via MethodChannel

### Widgets
- `TodoWidget`: Displays a single todo item with checkbox and title

### Pages
- `TodoPage`: Main page displaying the list of todos and WebView

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript to Flutter Communication
The feature uses WebView's JavaScript Channel (`flutter_todo`) to send messages from JavaScript to Flutter. The web interface includes a button that creates a new todo item when clicked.

### Flutter to Native Communication
When a todo item is tapped, the app uses MethodChannel (`com.lifebliss.app/todo`) to call native code to display a dialog on the native platform.

### Native Implementation
The native implementation (Android) receives method calls through the MethodChannel and displays a native AlertDialog with the todo details.

## Testing
The Todo feature includes:
- Unit tests for the Todo model and TodoWidget
- Mock tests for the TodoService
- Integration tests that verify the end-to-end functionality

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Todo page from the home screen by tapping the list icon in the app bar
2. View existing todos, mark them as completed/uncompleted, or tap them to see details in a native dialog
3. Add new todos using the floating action button
4. The WebView section allows creating todos from JavaScript by clicking the "Create Sample Todo" button

## Technical Considerations
- The WebView communication uses JSON for structured data exchange
- Native communication handles errors gracefully with Flutter fallbacks
- The UI adapts to different screen sizes with an appropriate layout
